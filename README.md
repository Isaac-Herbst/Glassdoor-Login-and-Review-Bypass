# Glassdoor Content Unlocker

This is a simple userscript that automatically removes content restrictions on [Glassdoor] (https://glassdoor.com), including blur effects, scrolling blocks, and interactivity issues. It works on all subdomains of Glassdoor and allows you to access content without providing a review or salary.

## Features
- Removes blur and backdrop filter effects.
- Restores scrolling functionality.
- Enables clickable behavior for blocked elements.
- Works seamlessly on all Glassdoor subdomains, at least on Chrome-based browsers.

## Installation
To use this script, you need a userscript manager such as Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey, or SleazyFork.

### Install the Script
Working on getting a clickable link that will directly install the userscript into the monkey script managers, like found  [**here**](https://github.com/zerodytrash/Simple-YouTube-Age-Restriction-Bypass). For now, simply copy the contents of that .js script into your userscript manager.

### How to Use
1. Install the script by copying the .js file into a new script on the managers.
2. Save the script, make sure it is enabled.
3. Navigate to any Glassdoor page.
4. The script will automatically remove restrictions upon page load.
